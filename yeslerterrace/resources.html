<h1 align="center"> Yesler Youth Tutoring Program 
    (Catholic Services) </h1>

<p align="center"> YTP is an after-school educational enrichment program for first through 
  twelfth-grade students who live in six low-income and public housing communities in Seattle.
   Started as a partnership with the Seattle Housing Authority in 1991, the tutoring centers provide
    youth with a safe, positive, and stimulating environment to explore learning and experience academic 
    and personal success. Volunteers are the heart of the program. They work with students individually 
    or in pairs to follow each student’s individualized learning plan. At the tutoring centers, students
     build skills in reading and math, get help with homework, and grow their confidence. There are six 
     YTP tutoring centers located throughout Seattle. Centers are open in the late afternoon and early
      evening hours. YTP students are wonderfully diverse, representing many nationalities, cultures,
       languages, and religions.
